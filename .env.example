# Example environment variables for local development
# Frontend API base URL exposed to the browser. On Vercel set this in Project Settings
# as an Environment Variable so the client can reach your backend. Provide only the
# protocol + host (optionally include `/api`). Examples:
# - Local dev (backend running locally on port 5001):
#   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5001
# - If you're using a Cloudflare Tunnel for local backend: (example)
#   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://abcd1234.yourdomain.com
# When set, the frontend will append `/api` automatically if needed.

# Note: When deploying to Vercel set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in Project Settings. For
# local public exposure we recommend Cloudflare Tunnel (`cloudflared`) which provides
# a stable hostname when routed to a domain you control.

# Optional: Remote attendance synchronization
# If you want the laptop running the backend to push attendance to a persistent
# remote endpoint (so others can view it after the laptop is turned off), set:
# REMOTE_SAVE_URL=https://your-remote-endpoint.example/receive-attendance
# Optionally, provide a bearer token for authentication:
# REMOTE_SAVE_TOKEN=your_secret_token

# Note: The project no longer uses a GitHub Gist-based remote receiver.
# To update the public site, commit and push `public/attendance.json` and
# `public/card_names.json` to the repository; Vercel will redeploy and
# the site will serve the committed files.

# Security reminder: Never commit or paste your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) into public chat or a repo.
# If you accidentally exposed a token (for example by pasting it into chat), revoke it now and create a new one.
